    <h3>Pork adobo is the beloved national dish of the Philippines.</h3>
    <p>Pork adobo is a quintessential Filipino dish that showcases the harmonious blend of salty, tangy, and garlicky
        flavors through the slow simmering of pork in a marinade of soy sauce, vinegar, and aromatics, resulting in a
        deeply savory and tender stew that epitomizes the comforting essence of Philippine cuisine.</p>

    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the pork (belly or shoulder/butt cuts are recommended), soy sauce, and crushed garlic in a bowl
                or pot. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the marinated pork and cook for a few minutes until lightly
                browned</li>
            <li>Pour in the remaining marinade along with whole peppercorns and dried bay leaves. Add water or broth
                (about 1 1/2 cups) and bring to a boil</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork is very
                tender. Add more liquid if it dries out too much</li>
            <li>Pour in vinegar (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup, depending on your taste preference) and let it simmer for 12-15
                more minutes to allow the vinegar to mellow out </li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning by adding salt if needed </li>
            <li>Optionally, you can let the adobo rest overnight to allow the flavors to develop further. The next day,
                you can fry the pork pieces briefly to create a crispy exterior before serving</li>
            <li>Serve the adobo hot, with the sauce poured over the meat. It is traditionally eaten with white rice</li>
        </ol>
